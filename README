=  Description:  =
==================
Both ConvexHull program and PointSetBinaryOperations program are using the Point and PointSet
classes. These programs use only the interface given in the 'PointSet.h' file.

Point Class:
    Represent a single Point in the plane, with X and Y coordinates.
    The Point holds several methods to perform operations that serve the PointSet Class,
    for example the PolarAngle() which calculates the angle of a given Point with the Point
    that called this method.
    Even though these methods are used to serve the PointSet methods, it seems more proper to
    implement them in the Point Class, because these operations are related to specific Point
    and not the entire Set.

PointSet Class:
    The PointSet Class represent a Set which holds Points.
    The Set itself is implemented as a private member of this Class, and the user has
    no access to it.
    The Set itself is an array of pointers to Points. It is a dynamic array, i.e. it's actual size
    is changed during the addition operations (it only increase it's capacity but not decrease).
    The PointSet allows to add new Points and remove Points (as a Set it does not allow duplicates).
    The PointSet also allows to call several Sorting operations on itself, basically used in the
    Convex Hull program.
    The PointSet overloaded several operators which are demonstrated in the PointSetBinaryOperations
    program.

The ConvexHull program use PointSet in order to receive and store input from the user and then
calculate the Convex Hull of the input.

The PointSetBinaryOperations is just a simple demonstration of the several operators that was
overloaded in the PointSet class.
